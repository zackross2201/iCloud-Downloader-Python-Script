Intro (don't have to read)
--------------------------
So, I just got a NAS and I needed to download my iCloud Photos and Videos to put on there.
Apple is akward.
REALLY akward.
And they only let you download 1000 at one time,meaning I would have had 26 .zip files all named "iCloud Photos"
So today, I decided that I needed to do something or i'll be paying for iCloud and more phone storage.
And here it is.

-------------------------
What is it?
-------------------------
This is a python file that you run, enter in your apple details (I know it sounds like I'm about to hack you BUT its all kept locally on your device)
The python file will go up to iCloud and download every single photo and video.

-------------------------
Does it all just get dumped in my Downloads o-
-------------------------
No.
If it did I actaully would not be posting it.
I don't think I'm the only here who would not want a downloads folder with Tim Cook written all over it.

-------------------------
Where are the files saved then?
-------------------------
I bet you would download this file and put it on your desktop.
The files would go on your desktop.
Saved it in Downloads?
It goes there.
It goes wherever you saved it in a folder.
The files get sorted out by Year and then Months.
For exmaple: "D:\icloud_photo_backup\2023\04\1000000250.heic"

------------------------
Problems that may occur and what to-do
------------------------
Some you may see that it says "Failed to connect to iCloud" or something along the lines of that.
That just means after that you'll need to run the script again and those files should download, as the file skips whats already there.

-----------------------
Things to point out:
-----------------------
1. I would run it as many times as you want, the file skips whats already been downloaded.
2. As mentioned, No I won't hack your iCloud. I can't see a single thing anyone does.
3. It's a .py file thats got it's own interface so you dont have to fiddle with command prompt or terminal
4. I tested on Windows, if it dosen't work on Mac or Linux I wouldnt know.

-----------------------
Download from Google Drive or Onedrive if you can't from GitHub for some reason.
